# POA Pokemon
**2020 update: I turned-down the intership offer, and I turned off the bot. It should work fine if one were to run it though.**

> Profile of a Pokemon

This bot is hosted on Telegram, chat with it on [https://t.me/poa_pokemon_bot](https://t.me/poa_pokemon_bot).

## Commands

#### `/pokeinfo [pokemon_name]`

> Example : `/pokeinfo Pikachu` or `/pokeinfo 9`

Sends a GET request to PokeAPI and shows the string in a way that is understandable by users, or in simple words, combine API response with a bunch of other strings.

## Developing

```shell
git clone http://github.com/drepram/poa-pokemon
cd poa-pokemon
yarn install
node index.js # i would suggest using nodemon instead
```
